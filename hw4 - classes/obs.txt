in employee.cpp
- Moved constructor to employee.h

in employee.h
- changed constructors
- changed tostring function

in student.cpp
- moved constructor to student.h

in student.h
- changed constructors
- changed tostring function 


What I have found so far, is that in both .h files I wrote the tostring function incorrectly 
because I forgot to include a call to the parent tostring function, which would grab the personal information of the person.
Also, my understanding of the constructors was incorrect. I misunderstood that the constructor to the base class was inherent to the sub class.
As well, I did not create a constructor that takes a parameter of an instantiation of the person class correctly in my second constructor. 
So, what I needed to differently was write both constructors so that they would also "call" (if thats the right term?) the person class. 
This is how the personal information would be "passed" (if thats also the right term?) in. 
Lastly, I needed to include the setting of the employee id, seniority level, and rating, which I believe you accomplished through the lines:

"...employeeID(eID),
seniorityLevel(sLvl),
rating(rtg)".

I hope i have accurately described the mistakes I made, and I think I understand what I need to do differently next time. I feel that I have gained 
a better understanding of inheritance and the construction of classes. The only question I have is did code that I quoted above effectively set the
values of employeeID to eID, seniorityLevel to sLvl, rating to rtg?

Thank You!
